# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Fabric 1.21.1 support (Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API)
- Native Fabric registration, networking, lifecycle, reload listener, config, and capability wiring
- Trinkets integration as the Fabric equivalent of Curios
- Compatibility modules for AzureLib, Female Gender, GeckoLib, JEI, and playerAnimator on Fabric

### Changed
- Replaced NeoForge side-marker stubs (Dist, OnlyIn, FMLEnvironment) with native Fabric environment APIs
- Replaced NeoForge config stubs with NightConfig-backed config implementation
- Moved internal NeoForge-shaped compatibility types into Epic Fight's own namespace to avoid classpath collisions
- Required initialization now fails fast instead of silently catching errors
- `neoforge_compat` is now a fully optional integration: dropped from `depends`, removed from the build classpath, and all event bridging goes through `NeoForgeCompatBridge` via reflection when the mod is present

### Fixed
- Config class collision with ForgeConfigAPIPort causing `NoSuchMethodError` on startup
- Mouse binding and block breaking not working in Epic Fight combat mode
- Inverted block outline cancellation logic
- Held-item flat shading caused by misread baked lightmap normals
- Baked-light UV offset in patched item rendering
- `/epicfight skill add` crashing system-chat encoding by passing raw `ResourceLocation` into translatable components
- Combo arithmetic crash on movesets containing only two entries
- Skill Book right-click opening a blurred screen without the parchment content; restored the original book layout
- Skill Book category colors, symbols, and held/inventory/creative-tab rendering; category models now resolve to quads via the Fabric model-loading path
- GLFW error from polling unbound keys (`GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN`) in combat mode input checks
- Client boot failure caused by stale diagnostic mixins
- `NoClassDefFoundError: net/neoforged/bus/api/Event` on plain Fabric instances without `neoforge_compat`

### For Devs
- `AnimationManager.AnimationRegistryEvent` is a plain class on Fabric; when `neoforge_compat` is present it is posted on `NeoForgeCompat.MOD_BUS` via `postAny`, so listeners must match the concrete event type rather than `Event` supertypes
- Addons that rely on NeoForge-style events must declare `neoforge_compat` themselves — Epic Fight no longer ships or requires it

### Known Limitations
- Controlify and KubeJS are not currently supported on Fabric
- Epic Fight: Skill Tree and ParCool have no Fabric versions
- Several mod integrations (Iris, Sodium, 3D Skin Layers, etc.) have code present but are pending dedicated verification

## [21.17.3] - 2026-5-14
### Additions
- Added Item Specific Overrides to Builder to allow any explicit tier configurations.
- Added Simply Tooltips Compatibility with a plethora of Epic Fight's own features.
### Changes
- Used `@WrapOperation` instead of `@Redirect` to improve compatibility with other mods' mixins.
### Deprecations
- Deprecated `setWeaponData()` as `modifyBuilder()` made the formet method redundant.
### Fixes
- More inheritance issues regarding `WeaponCapability`
- Custom Data in Item Presets not working due to logic error.
- Skills not using `isWeaponCategory()`

## [21.17.2] - 2026-05-12
### Additions
- Added builder modifiers to `WeaponModifier` just a small addition that gives more power to addon developers.
### Hotfixes
- Fixed Issue regarding dual wielding not working. Caused by a weapon category match being that just passing the entire weapon cap instead of just the category.
- Fixed weapon category and collider inheritance by setting them to null and only adding the first categories if it stayed null from inheritance.

## [21.17.1] - 2026-04-29
### Changes
**ExCap**

---
 - Introduced the Hybrid Registry System
   - The hybrid Registry system uses the DeferredRegister to register new data statically, while also allowing Datapacks to override it down the line.
     - DeferredRegister registers it upon static compile-time while datapacks then override it upon a world load or running /reload
 - Added Modifiers – A replacement of ExCap's system for Dynamic Overrides
 - Existing ExCap registration for Core Epic Fight content has been turned from event driven into Registry Driven via DeferredRegister.
 - Added the option to register a Weapon Capability monolithically via just the Builder. Modularity is no longer forced.
 - Implemented Inheiritance for `WeaponCapability.Builder` allowing even faster prototyping and building of new weapons.
 - Implemented `CustomData` a new way for addons to extend on weapon data using datapacks and code. All is done in DeferredRegister. Either as weapon data or as moveset data. Java can be used to extend both Weapon and Moveset data. Datapacks and JSON can only be used to extend Weapon data.
 - **Experimental Change:** Introduced `WeaponCategory` inheiritance which uses multiple inheiritance for its weapon categories.
 - Mass deprecation of as many old `WeaponCapabilityPresets` weapons and Old ExCap methods that were deemed extremely difficult to work with and extremely tedious to use.

---

- Added Hand switching item animation
- Added max passive skills gamerule. `/gamerule maxPassiveSkills <value>`
- Added animation mirroring for combo weapons and living animations.
- Made it so roll/dodge skills cannot be performed midair.
- Made it so you cannot spam dash attacks.
- Tweaks to the Skill equipping window GUI. No longer closes when equipping a skill and some other tweaks here and there.

### Fixes
- Fixed biped entities mounted atop horses & other entities rendering all weird. The skeletons on top of spiders (spider jockeys) should be more visually pleasing. Same goes for the Chicken jockey.
- Fixed the tools being misplaced on skeletons when they sit/mount on other entities
- Fixed chicken jockey behavior, now it attacks the player and targets it properly.

- Epic Fight's TPS perspective will be automatically disabled when a conflicting mod, such
  as [Shoulder Surfing Reloaded](https://modrinth.com/mod/shoulder-surfing-reloaded)
  or [Better Third Person](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-third-person), is detected to prevent issues.
- Explicit Shoulder Surfing compatibility with the new
  enhanced lock-on (credit [Exopandora](https://github.com/Exopandora)).
  [#2258](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2258)

### Fixed

- Disabled the `AzureLib` and `AzureLibArmor` compatibility modules for version `3.X.X` and newer as a workaround to
  address breaking changes and prevent crashes.
- Fixed the player kicked from a dedicated server when other players are equipping Adaptive Skin skill

### For Devs

    - The feature is still WIP, supporting only events for EpicFightCameraAPI
    - We will eventually replace all Forge/NeoForge events owned by Epic Fight into Hooks
- Added API JAR file, which includes classes under `yesman/epicfight/api/**` only, to allow consumers to compile against
  Epic Fight public API only.
    - **Note:** Keep in mind that Epic Fight public APIs are still being stabilized, and breaking changes may occur. 

## [21.13.5] - 2025-11-12

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression where the Phantom Ascent skill was triggered when
  pressing the jump key while any screen was open (e.g., inventory, chat).
  [#2170](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2170)

- Fixed a cosmetic configuration button always inactivated
- Fixed an unintended mechanism where you weren't able to attack in Epic Fight
  mode while Preference Work is set to Switch Mode, so it works in the same way
  as Item Auto Switching option, an old config where automatically sets player
  mode depending on the item that player holds

### Changed

- Refactored the code to eliminate unnecessary native GLFW calls,
  optimizing whether key down checks are performed per tick, by adapting
  Minecraft vanilla `KeyMapping`, which may also potentially fix other compatibility issues with other mods.
- Avoid registering mixins for non-existing third-party mods to avoid spamming the console log and prevent unnecessary operations.

### For Devs
- Adopted KeyConflictContext for each keybind as documented by [Neoforge](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/misc/keymappings/#ikeyconflictcontext) to avoid potential problem from inconsistency
- Made GUARD and DODGE CombatKeyMapping, to activate only in Epic Fight mode
